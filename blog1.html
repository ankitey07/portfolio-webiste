        <h2>Education Nepal</h2>
        Hey everyone, I want to talk about education and  schools in Nepal. <br><br> I'm kind of frustrated with how things are going. It feels like our system is crushing students' creativity every day. <br>

In most schools, teachers just stand at the front, writing stuff on the board, and we students copy it down without really getting what it means. We just memorize it for tests. I used to do that too, but then I realized there's a better way. <br>

I'm tired of it. We need to change things up. Teachers should let students figure things out on their own. They should use cool stuff like online classes and videos to help us understand better.

<br>I know the change is not an eazy process, but if we all chip in, we can make a big difference in it in future. Let's work together to make learning awesome. <br><br> This is just my perspective, I'm not telling anyone wrong here.
